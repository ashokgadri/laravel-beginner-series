# Laravel Beginner Series – Source Code

This repository contains the source code for the **Laravel Beginner Series** on YouTube.

The goal of this series is to help beginners understand **how Laravel works step by step**, by explaining core concepts clearly and building a real application in a predictable way.

Each video in the series corresponds to a **Git tag**, so you can check out the **exact code state** used in that video and follow along without confusion.
